Template 
we use template for not writing same function and logic many time for many data type .
Our main motive is to pass data type as an  argument so that compiler can modify that code block as per given datatype.
it is easy to debug.
it is less error prone.
it is a part of compilation phase.
Macros 
it simply replace the code by value without type checking.
it is difficult to debug.
it is error prone.
it happens in pre-processor phase.
